  timezone: "America/New_York"
  business_hours:
    start: "09:00"
    end: "17:00"
    days: ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
```

## üîê **Permission Requirements**

### **For the Target Calendar, You Need:**
- **Read Access**: To check existing appointments and availability
- **Write Access**: To create, update, and delete appointments
- **Manage Access**: To set reminders and notifications

### **How to Grant Access:**
1. **If you own the calendar**: No additional setup needed
2. **If it's shared with you**: Ask the owner to grant "Make changes to events" permission
3. **If it's a business calendar**: Contact your Google Workspace administrator

## üöÄ **Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Choose Your Target Calendar**
1. Decide which calendar you want to use for appointments
2. Get the calendar ID using one of the methods above
3. Note the timezone of the calendar

### **Step 2: Update Configuration**
1. Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml`
2. Edit the calendar section:
   ```yaml
   calendar:
     target_calendar_id: "YOUR_CALENDAR_ID_HERE"
     timezone: "YOUR_TIMEZONE"
   ```

### **Step 3: Test Access**
1. Run the setup command:
   ```bash
   python main.py --setup
   ```
2. The system will test access to your target calendar
3. Verify the calendar name and timezone are correct

### **Step 4: Verify Permissions**
1. Try creating a test appointment
2. Check that it appears in your target calendar
3. Verify that reminders and notifications work

## üîß **Advanced Calendar Configuration**

### **Multiple Calendar Support**
The system can be extended to work with multiple calendars:

```python
# In calendar_manager.py, you could add:
def check_availability_across_calendars(self, start_time, end_time):
    """Check availability across multiple calendars"""
    calendars = [self.calendar_id] + self.config.get('calendar.backup_calendars', [])
    
    for cal_id in calendars:
        if self._is_time_available(cal_id, start_time, end_time):
            return True
    return False
```

### **Calendar-Specific Settings**
You can configure different settings for different calendars:

```yaml
calendar:
  target_calendar_id: "primary"
  calendar_specific_settings:
    primary:
      business_hours:
        start: "09:00"
        end: "17:00"
      buffer_time: 15
    business:
      business_hours:
        start: "08:00"
        end: "18:00"
      buffer_time: 30
```

## ‚ùì **Common Questions**

### **Q: Can I use a calendar I don't own?**
**A**: Yes, as long as you have been granted write access to it. The calendar owner needs to share it with you and give you "Make changes to events" permission.

### **Q: What if the calendar is in a different timezone?**
**A**: The system will automatically handle timezone conversion. Set the `timezone` field in your config to match your business timezone, and the system will convert times appropriately.

### **Q: Can I schedule appointments in multiple calendars?**
**A**: Currently, the system targets one primary calendar, but this can be extended to support multiple calendars for different types of appointments.

### **Q: What happens if I lose access to the calendar?**
**A**: The system will show an error when trying to create or modify appointments. You'll need to either regain access or change the `target_calendar_id` to a calendar you do have access to.

### **Q: Can I use a calendar from a different Google account?**
**A**: Yes, as long as that calendar is shared with your authenticated account. You'll need to authenticate with the account that has access to the target calendar.

## üéØ **Best Practices**

1. **Use a Dedicated Business Calendar**: Create a separate calendar specifically for your photography business
2. **Set Appropriate Permissions**: Ensure only necessary people have access to your business calendar
3. **Regular Backups**: Export your calendar data regularly as a backup
4. **Test Permissions**: Always test calendar access after making changes
5. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of API usage to avoid hitting Google's limits

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Error: "Calendar not found"**
- Verify the calendar ID is correct
- Ensure you have access to the calendar
- Check that the calendar hasn't been deleted

### **Error: "Insufficient permissions"**
- Ask the calendar owner to grant you write access
- Verify you're authenticated with the correct account
- Check if the calendar requires special permissions

### **Error: "Invalid calendar ID"**
- Make sure the calendar ID format is correct
- Remove any extra spaces or characters
- Try using "primary" for your main calendar
